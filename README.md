# 🧠 Mini C Compiler in C

This is a Mini C Compiler written in pure C, capable of performing lexical analysis, parsing, symbol table management, and executing a subset of C-style statements. It's a great learning project to understand the basics of how compilers work.

---

## Features

- ✅ Tokenizer (Lexical Analyzer)
- ✅ Recursive Descent Parser
- ✅ Symbol Table for Variables
- ✅ Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Execution
- ✅ Supports simple:
  - `int` variable declarations
  - Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
  - `if` statements
  - `while` loops
  - `print` statements

## 📝 Example Code It Can Interpret

```c
int x = 10;
int y = 5;
if (x > y) {
  print x + y;
}
```

## 🧪 Sample Output

```
Output: 15
```
